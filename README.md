# Analysis of BioImages (in Progress)

# Abstract
This project aims at analysing micrographs and other images of biological matter. The underlying data can be obtained freely from many scientific bioinformatics databases (check out my website www.bio-century.net for further info). This "Part 1" is a collection of Python-based example codes focussing on the Analysis of Micrographs on a very basic level. More parts are to come soon...<br>
Goals and example code is presented in a Jupyter-Notebook-(.ipynb-)fileformat. Jupyter-NB or equivalent extensions in the IDE of your choice is thus required to modify it.

Example of a test dataset identifying multi-nuclei overlays in fluorescence micrographs:<br>

## <a id='GettingStarted'></a> Getting Started
All you need is a running jupyter notebook distribution of some sort as well as python fulfilling the requirements listed in section [Requirements](#-requirements). Strongly recommended is vs code with it's .ipynb-extension 


### <a id='InspirationsAndToDos'></a> Inspirations & ToDo's
Here is room for your inspiration, which is very much appreciated! Please be patient as concerns implementationof your ideas, since the resources (time and personnel) are limited.
